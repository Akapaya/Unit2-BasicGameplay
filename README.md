# Unity Project: Shooter

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of the official Unity course. This project is a gameplay challenge, making a shooter-up, the content was improved using MVC and Object Pool.

## Project description

### Shooter-up Gameplay
In the game, players face challenges when shooting random enemies that fall randomly, to shoot the player needs to press "space", performance features were applied even without being included in the Unity course project.
